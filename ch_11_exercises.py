# TODO 11.1 Introduction to Inheritance

# You are going to create a Dwelling class based on the
# Automobile sample from the chapter

# 1) Create the class Dwelling, the __init__ method should accept number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors

        self.number_of_rooms = number_of_rooms

# 2) Add mutators for all of the data attributes (number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors)

    def set_number_of_rooms(self, num_room):
        self.number_of_rooms = num_room

    def set_square_feet(self, num_sq_ft):
        self.square_feet = num_sq_ft

    def set_floors(self, floor_num):
        self.floors = floor_num

# 3) Add accessors for all of the data attributes

    def get_number_of_rooms(self):
        return self.number_of_rooms

    def get_square_feet(self):
        return self.square_feet

    def get_floors(self):
        return self.floors

# 4) Create the class Single_family_home as a sub class of Dwelling
# The __init__ method should accept number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors, garage_type, yard_size
# -- Call the __init__ of superclass Dwelling and pass the required arguments, remember to include self
# -- Initialize the garage_type and yard_size attributes

        self.garage_type = garage_type
        self.yard_size = yard_size

# 5) Create the mutator and accessor methods for the garage_type and yard_size attributes
    def set_garage_type(self, garage_type):
        self.garage_type = garage_type

    def get_garage_type(self):

        self.yard_size = yard_size

    def get_yard_size(self):
        return self.yard_size


# 7) Create an object from the Single_family_home class with the following information:
# 6 rooms, 1200 square feet, 1 floor, single car garage, .25 acres


home = SingleFamilyHome(6, 1200, 1, 'Single Car Garage', '.25 acres')

# 8) Display the data using the accessor methods

print('Rooms: ', home.get_number_of_rooms())
print('Square Feet: ', home.get_square_feet())
print('Floors: ', home.get_floors())
print('Garage Type: ', home.get_garage_type())

# TODO 11.2 Polymorphism
print("=" * 10, "Section 11.2 polymorphism", "=" * 10)
# 1) Type in the mammal class from program 11-9, lines 1 - 22

    def show_species(self):
        print('I am a', self.__species)

    def make_sound(self):
        print('Yare yare da ze')

# 2) Create a Mouse class as a sub class of the mammal class following the Dog example


class Mouse(Mammal):
    def __init__(self):
        Mammal.__init__(self, 'Mouse')

    def make_sound(self):
        print('Squeak!')


# 3) Create a Bird class as a sub class of the mammal class following the Cat Example

class Bird(Mammal):
    def __init__(self):
        Mammal.__init__(self, 'Bird')

    def make_sound(self):
        print('Chirp!!')

# 4) Follow the example in program 11-10 (no need to import, use main2 instead of main
#    because there is already a main on this page) use the Mouse and Bird class that you created


def show_mammal_info(creature):
    creature.show_species()
    creature.make_sound()


def main2():
    mammalOBJ = Mammal('Regular Animal')
    mouseOBJ = Mouse()

    print()
    show_mammal_info(mammalOBJ)
    print()
    show_mammal_info(mouseOBJ)
    print()
